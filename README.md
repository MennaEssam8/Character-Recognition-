# Introduction
Character recognition is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision, playing a critical role in applications such as automated document reading, text recognition, and digitization of handwritten content. This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognizing handwritten characters using the EMNIST Letters dataset from Kaggle.

The EMNIST dataset is an extended version of the popular MNIST dataset, specifically designed to handle both uppercase and lowercase handwritten letters. It contains 26 balanced classes of letters, making it a rich dataset for training machine learning models. Using CNN, a deep learning architecture that excels in image-related tasks, we aim to develop a robust model capable of accurately identifying handwritten characters.

CNNs are particularly well-suited for this task due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. By applying filters, pooling, and activation functions, CNNs can effectively capture patterns in handwriting, enabling the model to generalize across various writing styles.

In this project, we preprocess the EMNIST Letters dataset, design and train a CNN model, and evaluate its performance. The model's ability to correctly recognize characters has broad implications for optical character recognition (OCR) systems and real-world applications such as automated license plate reading, postal code scanning, and intelligent document processing.
